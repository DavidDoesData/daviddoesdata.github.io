## Who Am I?

Uh, hi. I'm David.

I've been developing web apps for about 10 years, and now I have the opportunity to start working with data analytics. This is the repo I'm using for all of my projects related to predictive analytics, machine learning, and data science


## What Am I Doing Here?
Learning about data science. Maybe slowly, I do have a full time job. Just sayin'.
