## Project Goal
Build a site using R Markdown in R Studio. Host it on GitHub.

## Challenges
I don't use a ton of markdown in general, and I'm a lazy UI designer. I'll have to start with a base set of styles, and then either alter that css or create a new css file based on that one.

We'll see how it goes.

Also, I want to try embedding a slide show. I'm not sure how that'll work with the site being hosted on GitHub.
